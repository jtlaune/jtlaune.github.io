I'm currently a fourth year at the University of Chicago, where I
study math and physics. My interests include astrophysics and plasmas,
and I currently am working on protoplanetary disks at LANL as a SULI intern.
In Chicago, I'm a research assistant at the Flash Center, where I work on
MHD simulations of plasmas. In my free time, I like to build keyboards and
make my computer look pretty.
